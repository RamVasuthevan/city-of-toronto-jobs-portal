As I will be the only maintainer, that is true

The code should be self-documenting. We should use comments sparingly and only when necessary.

Use constants to store magic variables. 

It should be easy to understand what the code does by reading, main.py. 

It should be clear clear what a function does by it's name.

Extract helper functions which add clutter, whose purposes are obvious and do not help and understanding the code to utils.py. like DateEncoder.

Commets which are written must be maintained.
